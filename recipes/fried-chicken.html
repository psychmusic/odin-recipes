        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This recipe is courtesy of culinary genius Alton Brown.  Moist, juicy deep-fried bettermilk chicken with a crisp, golden crust is what you can expect to create when this is all said and done.  Alton refers to this dish as "General's Chicken" because generals outrank colonels.  Fried chicken is a delicous dish, very popular in the southern US, but should be appreciated throughout the world.  Note that the recipe calls for a chicken that has been cut into pieces (as in you break down a whole chicken yourself); however, feel free to have a butcher handle that for you or simply purchase a mixture of pre-cut bone-in pieces.  If you decide to fry the breast make sure that the rib cage is still in place and that the entire wing has been removed.</p>
