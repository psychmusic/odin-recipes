        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This recipe is courtesy of culinary genius Alton Brown.  Moist, juicy deep-fried bettermilk chicken with a crisp, golden crust is what you can expect to create when this is all said and done.  Alton refers to this dish as "General's Chicken" because generals outrank colonels.  Fried chicken is a delicous dish, very popular in the southern US, but should be appreciated throughout the world.  <strong>Note</strong> that the recipe calls for a chicken that has been cut into pieces (as in you break down a whole chicken yourself); however, feel free to have a butcher handle that for you or simply purchase a mixture of pre-cut bone-in pieces.  If you decide to fry the breast make sure that the rib cage is still in place and that the entire wing has been removed.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (4 to 5 pound) chicken, cut into 10 pieces (<strong>see note in description</strong>)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons ground sumac</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
            <li>1 cup low-fat buttermilk</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons bourbon</li>
            <li>2 quarts peanut oil, for frying</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Place the chicken pieces on a wire rack set over a half sheet pan and sprinkle on all sides with salt.  Set aside at room temperature for 30 minutes.</p></li>
            <li><p>Combine the black pepper, sumac, cayenne, and garlic powder in a small bowl, then divide the blend in half.  Sprinkle the chicken on all sides with half of the spice mixture, then refrigerate, uncovered, for at least 4 hours or up to overnight.</p></li>
            <li><p>Whe nyou're ready to cook, remove the chicken from the refrigerator.  Whisk together the flour, cornstarch, and the remaining spice mixture in a large bowl.  In another bowl, whisk together the butttermilk, egg, and bourbon.</p></li>
            <li><p>One piece at a time, dunk the chicken pieces into the buttermilk mixture, then dredge in the flour mixture.  Use your fingers to massage the flour coating onto the chicken.  Place the coated pieces back on the wire rack and rest at lesat 10 minutes or up to 1 hour at room temperature.</p></li>
            <li><p>Meanhwile, heat the peanut oil ot 350°F in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat, about 15 minutes.  Line a rimmed baking sheet with paper towels and place a wire cooling rack upside down on the paper towels.</p></li>
            <li><p>When the oil is hot, fry the chicken in three batches, rotating the pieces every 3 to 4 minutes, until the chicken is golden brown and its interior temperature is 155°F, about 10 minutes (it helps to fry the wite meat pieces together in their own batches and the dark meat together in their own batches).  Adjust the heat as needed to maintin 325°F.  Rest the chicken on the prepared rack for at least 5 minutes before serving.  The chicken is equally good at room temperature as it is hot, so don't worry about keeping it warm between batches.</p></li>
