        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><p>Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil.  Working in batches, cook the lasagna noodles until they are soft and pliable but not limp, 
                    6 to 7 minutes.  Remove the pasta from the boiling water and lay flat on a sheet tray to cool.  Reserve.</p></li>
                <li><p>Coat a large saute pan with olive oil and bring to medium-high heat.  Add the sausage and cook until brown and crumbly.  Remove from pan 
                    and reserve on paper towels.</p></li>
                <li><p>Ditch the fat from the pan and add new olive oil along with 2 cloves of garlic and a pinch of crushed red pepper.  Bring the pan to medium-high heat.
                    When the garlic becomes golden and very aromatic, remove it form the heat and discard.  Toss in the mushrooms and season them with salt.  Cook the mushrooms
                    and season them with salt.  Cook the mushrooms until they are soft and wilted and dark brown, 4 to 5 minutes.  Remove from pan and reserve.  Repeat this
                    process with the remaining garlic and the zucchini.</p></li>
                <li><p>In a small bowl, combine the ricotta, 1/2 the Parmigiano-Reggiano, the eggs, and hte basil.  Mix to combine well and season with salt.</p></li>
                <li><p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.</p></li>
                <li><p>In the bottom of a 9 by 13-inch deep-dish baking dish, dd a couple of ladlefuls of sauce and spread out in an even layer.  Arrange a layer
                    of the lasagna noodles to completely cover the sauce.  Spread 1/3 of the ricotta mixture over the pasta.  Place a lyer of pasta going in the other
                    direction as the first layer (this will give a little more stability).  Spread a light layer of sauce on the pasta and sprinkle 1/3 of the sausage over
                    the sauce, repeat this process with 1/3 of the mushrooms and zucchini.  Sprinkle a layer of mozzarella and some of the remaining Parmigiano-Reggiano
                    over the veggies.  Repeate these layers until all the ingredients have been used up or the pan is full.  Be sure that there is a layer of pasta on top
                    covered with sauce and sprinkled with mozzarella and Parmigiano-Reggiano.  Cover with foil.</p></li>
                <li><p>Place the lasagna on a baking sheet and bake in the oven until the lasagna is hot and bubbly, about 1 hour 15 mintues, removing the foil for the last
                    15 minutes of cooking.  Let cool for 20 minutes before slicing.</p></li>
                <li><p>Note:  For optimal slicing, make and bake the lasagna the day before.  Heat it up again before slicing.</p></li>

                    <li><p>Coat a large suacepot with olive oil and add the pancetta.  Bring the pot to medium-high heat and cook the pancetta for 4 to 5 
                        minutes.  Add the onions, season generously with sault, and stir to coat with the olive oil.  Cook the onions for 6 to 7 minutes, stirring
                    frequently; the onion shoudl become very soft and aromatic but have no color.  Add the garlic and cook for anotehr 2 to 3 minutes, stirring frequently.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Pass the tomatoes through a food mill.  Be sure to pass all of the pulp through the holes leaving only the stems and the seeds, and be sure to scrape
                        the pulp off of the bottom of hte food mill.  That's all of the big money stuff!  Add the tomatoes to the pot and rinse out one of the empty tomato cans
                        with water and add that water to the pot (about 2 to 3 cups).  Season generously with salt and taste it; tomatoes take a lot of salt.  Season in baby steps and
                        taste every step of the way.  Cook the sauce for 2 to 3 hours, stirring occassionally and tasting frequently.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Use the sauce right away on pasta or for any other tomato sauce need.  This sauce canalso be cooled and stored in the fridge for a few days
                        or it freezes really well.</p></li>
