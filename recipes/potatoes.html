        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Do you want to make roasted, crispy potatoes with a creamy center?  If so, this is the recipe for you!  Kenji Lopez-Alt has done all of the 
            research and testing, so that you don't have to.  These will be "the most flavorful crispy roast potatoes that you'll ever make."  This recipe can also be
        gluten-free and vegan (if you use oil).</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Kosher salt</li>
                <li>Black pepper</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
                <li>4 pounds russet or Yukon gold potates, peeled and cut into quarters, sixths, or eights, depending on size (see note)</li>
                <li>5 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, duck fat, goose fat, or beef fat</li>
                <li>Small handful picked fresh rosemary leaves, finely chopped</li>
                <li>3 medium cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>Small handful fresh parsley leaves, minced</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <!-- do I need <p> elements on list items? -->
            <ol>
                <li>Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 450°F (or 400°F if using convection). Heat 2 quarts water in a large pot over high heat until
                    boiling.  Add 2 tablespoons kosher salt, baking soda, and potatoes and stir.  Return to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook until a knife meets
                    little resistance when inserted into a potato chunk, about 10 minutes after returning to boil.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, combine olive oil, duck fat, or beef fat wth rosemary, garlic, and afew grinds of black pepper in a small saucepan and heat over medium heat.  Cook, stirring and shaking constantly, until garlic just begins to turn golden, about 3 minutes.  Immediately strain oil through a fine-mesh strainer set in a large bowl.  Set garlic/rosemary mixture aside and reserve separately.</li>
                <li>Whe potatoes are cooked, drain carefully and let them rest in the pot for about 30 seconds to allow excess mosisture to evaporate.  Transfer to bowl wiht infused oil, season to taste with a little more salt and pepper, and toss to coat, shaking bowl roughly, until a think layer of mashed potato-like paste has built up on the potato chunks.</li>
                <li>Transfer potatoes to a large rimmed baking sheet and separate them, spreading them out evenly.  Transfer to oven and roast, without moving, for 20 minutes.  Using a thin flexible metal spatula to release any stuck potatoes, shake pan and turn potatoes.  Continue roasting until potatoes are deep brown and crisp all over, turning and shaking them a few times during cooking, 30 to 40 minutes longer.</li>
                <li>Transfer potatoes to a large bowl and add garlic/rosemary mixture and minced parsley.  Toss to coat and season with more salt and pepper to taste.  Serve immediately.</li>
